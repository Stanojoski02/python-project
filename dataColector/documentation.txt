Data collector documentation
A data collector is a project that collects data from web pages that it finds and writes to a CSV document. We must set it up correctly before starting the collection
*We must first have ChromeDriver installed 
*The path to the installed ChromeDriver should be entered in the variable path 
*Websites to be explored should be entered in the variable url between [] comma separated 
*In the same folder there should be a data.csv document which should initially have this value “Website url,Title,Description,Logo url,Email” 
then the collector is ready for operation
